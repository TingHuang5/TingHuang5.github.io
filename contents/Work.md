## Sensor engineer
### Sensor Project: 
Proficient in the basic knowledge and code of Hesai LiDAR, RoboSense LiDAR,
cameras, IMU, GNSS drivers and synchronization, as well as multi-sensor synchronization. Identify
and troubleshoot issues with the vehicle sensors as well as provide solutions to fix them.
### Daily work:
Test the basic characteristics and time synchronization of Ouster and Livox LiDAR. Test
the basic characteristics of Sensing and Leopard cameras.

## System engineer
### Daily work: 
Systematic learning of Linux, shell, git, cmake, ROS, C++ programming, QT, and visual
SLAM. Writing four software copyrights.
### Project: Guardian Program Upgrade: 
Familiar with the guardian code for various modules of the
whole vehicle's error information, and restructure the code for the radar protection, software node
monitoring module, and proto parameter reading part.
### Project: Perception_Parameter_Configurer GUI tool suite program upgrade: 
Refactoring the perception_ui interface, mainly responsible for refactoring the point cloud ground segmentation
parameters, radar information display, and real-time point cloud display code.
### Project: UDI_Rviz GUI tool suite program upgrade: 
Design a customized rviz tool for the company
based on the rviz source code, implementing point cloud, path, map display functions, and achieving
view movement and scaling functions based on different perspectives.
### Project: Recorder GUI tool suite program upgrade: 
Maintenance and upgrade of the company's
customized graphical interface program for recording and echoing topics.
### Project: Sensor Calibration GUI:
 Responsible for the overall online acquisition module, camera
intrinsic calibration module, and dual radar single board calibration module interface and functional
implementation, using PCL, OpenCV, and Ceres libraries to complete the development of the interface
display module.

# (2020.09-2021.04)GSK CNC Equipment CO., Ltd
## Intern of Algorithm Group
### Zero-point calibration Project: 
Reproduced the zero-point calibration method in Matlab by referring
to the method of Canop robot, optimized the 20-point calibration algorithm, and converted the method
into C language; Developed a GUI interface for robot zero calibration, and the calibration accuracy is
within 3mm.

### Graduation Project of the lightweight robot: 
complete the modeling of the six-axis robot whose 1, 4,
and 6 axes are not coplanar, and use the Newton method to solve the inverse kinematics of the robot.
After three iterations, the precision of the inverse solution reaches 10 -5 to meet the needs of practical
applications, and the Jacobian matrix singularity problem of the robot is judged by the screw method.
