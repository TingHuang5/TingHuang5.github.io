# Project: Application of Intelligent Optimization Algorithm in Parameter Identification of Photovoltaic System

- Pondered over the improvement strategy and improved the operator of the Learning Search Algorithm,
wrote and revised the paper of the improved Learning Search Algorithm.
- Used Matlab to program the improved algorithm and reproduced the programs in existing algorithms
which were used in the contrast experiments.
- Use the matlab simulink tool to build a model of the photovoltaic system to simulate the changing light
intensity and temperature for comparative experiments.
- Published the SCI paper entitled Parameter Identification for Photovoltaic Models Using an Improved
Learning Search Algorithm(First author)

# Dynamics Modeling and Gait Analysis of Transport-oriented Hexapod Robot(ICGNC 2020)
- Participated in the 2020 International Conference on Guidance, Navigation and Control.
- Participated in writing the paper entitled Dynamics Modeling and Gait Analysis of Transport-oriented Hexapod Robot, which was adopted and included by the conference.
- Mainly participated in writing and polishing the Hexapod robot decoupling part of the article.
